# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the DataStructure-And-Algorithm repository! This repository contains solutions to various data structure and algorithm problems. The solutions are organized by concepts and topics to help you navigate through them easily.

## About

This repository is maintained by Me and is intended to serve as a resource for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with basic concepts or an experienced programmer looking to refresh your skills, you'll find something useful here.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on different data structures, algorithms, and concepts. Each folder contains implementations, explanations, and sometimes additional resources related to that topic.

Here's a brief overview of the main folders:

- `Arrays`: Contains solutions related to array data structure problems.
- `Linked Lists`: Contains solutions related to linked list data structure problems.
- `Trees`: Contains solutions related to tree data structure problems, including binary trees, binary search trees, and more.
- `Sorting Algorithms`: Contains implementations of various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, etc.
- `Searching Algorithms`: Contains implementations of various searching algorithms such as linear search, binary search, etc.
- `Graphs`: Contains solutions related to graph data structure problems.

Feel free to explore the folders and dive into the topics that interest you the most!
